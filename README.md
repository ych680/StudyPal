## Project management tool

We used Jira as our porject managment tool, we used it to track progress, plan the specific task to be done within the timeline and the distribution of tasks to each member. We also used the timeline to make a gannt chart.

Technologies we used to build the project

-
- We used javascript as our front end, specifically react native as the frameowork. We also aminly used expo which is another framework based on react native to do our software development.
- We used google firebase as our databse and backend, more specifically firestore database as our databse. We also used firebase to achieve the authentication when the studypal app user login and signup while using the app. The language we used for backend is also javascript.  
  React native version we used: "0.72.5"  
  Expo version we used: "~49.0.7"

Usage example

-
- This app is designed specifically for student that need tutroing help at the university of auckland. The tutor could be a university student or anyone who are sufficient in the area they want to tutor.
- Say that you are a student at the university of auckland who are stuggling with python programming. you could sign up for this app,you could also choose to login with google easily. Then during the sign up, you could just choose the subject/area you wish to get tutored for. the homepage would recommend you tutors that are relvant to yout interest. From there on you could easily connect to the tutor you desire and message them to arrange more detailed meetings. You could also search for tutors in different subjects using the search bar or filter on the top of the homepage.

Future plan

-
- First is to publish the app on the google play store so more people could benefit from our studypal app, it would also be more convenent for students and tutors to install this app,
- After that, we plan to implment more subjects and different areas of expertise for students and tutors to choose from.
- Finally, we would like to include other universities and high schools in new zealnd as the range of service for this app. This means other students from other universities and high school could sign up and get tutored for subjects tought in their school. This helps reach a wider audience and popularity to our app, we also would be able to help more students with the need of tutoring.
