# Things/bugs to fix

## Chat/Messaging screens

- ~~For chats that are not at the top, need to send message twice to make it to the top.~~

- ~~Chats are not fully loaded on first render~~

- ~~Android styles are weird, e.g. bottom tab styles and gifted chat styles not working properly~~

- ~~Android navigation is weird, e.g., when pressed the back button on the messaging screen, it navigates to profile instead of chat~~

- ~~Load profile pictures for chat and messaging screens~~

- ~~When navigating to message from details screen, the splice function was not working and the chat was not updated to the top of the chat stacks.~~

- When new chat created, if still shows the chat even if there is no messages.

## Navigation

- ~~After logging out and then log back in, the go back navigation is not working properly in the details screen.~~
